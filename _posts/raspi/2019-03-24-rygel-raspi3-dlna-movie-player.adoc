== The need

I have a Raspberry 3 placed behind a 10 years old plasma LG tv.
Some years ago I configured Kodi and used it for some time, but 
eventually I dismissed it. Too heavy, too slow.

That raspi3 continued serving some docker containers but it was 
underutilized... so I started exploring some minimalistic alternative 
to heavyweight mediacenters, looking only for these features:

- play audio/video streams
- remote control i.e. from a smartphone

In the meantime I replaced my laptop hard disk with an SSD, so I 
attached it to an older raspberry 1 and got a minidlna media server. 

I found some articles talking about

- https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/79004/howto-install-dlna-media-renderer[using dlna to play audio]
- https://davidwiesner.github.io/posts/using-vlc-as-upnp-renderer-with-rygel/[Using VLC as UPnP renderer with rygel]


== The solution

I installed rygel but I got a lot of segfault and X server restart as 
soon as I started playing a movie. Then, after last updates, it started 
working like a charm.


== Practical steps


=== Install the system

So I started with a fresh Raspbian Stretch Lite 
https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest[image].

I installed LXQT to have a desktop environment.

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lightdm lxqt 
----

Then I gave a `sudo raspi-config`, then hit _Boot Options_, _Desktop / CLI_ 
and _Desktop Autologin_ in order to have the desktop environment 
available at boot.


=== Install VLC and Rygel

After a reboot I installed vlc and rygel

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install rygel vlc rygel-playbin 
----

and issued a `sudo nano /etc/rygel.conf` in order to enable the mpris 
support:

/etc/rygel.conf
[source,bash]
----
[MPRIS]
enabled=true
----
(MPRIS gives rygel control over VLC)


=== Auto start in background

Rygel per-se is enough to play movies, but so far I've not found an easy way 
to launch the player full screen. VLC can be started full screen in 
background, so that it appears only when needed, leaving the desktop 
available for other stuff when not playing movies.

This is how I start automatically VLC
~/.config/autostart/vlc.desktop
[source,bash]
----
Name=VLC as Media Renderer
GenericName=UPnP/DLNA Rendering Services
Comment=UPnP/DLNA Rendering Services
# Translators: Search terms to find this application. Do NOT translate or localize the semicolons! The list MUST also end with a semicolon!
Keywords=mediarenderer;play;audio;video;pictures;

X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Bugzilla=GNOME

X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Component=general
X-GNOME-Bugzilla-Version=3.0.6
----

I've linked rygel desktop config
`ln -s /usr/share/applications/rygel.desktop ~/.config/autostart/rygel.desktop`

Log out and log in again.


== Install a DLNA sender on the smartphone

Install a DLNA/UPnP Sender on the smartphone in order to control the 
player. I've tried BubbleUPnP and AirPinCast, they both work.

Then it is just a matter of choosing the media you want to play from any 
DLNA source and stream it to the raspi renderer. 

Enjoy your lighweight DLNA movie player!
